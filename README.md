Usage is included inside program manual.

Cautions:

If turn matchmaking back on it will immidiately have randoms join sometimes.
Therefore it's better to never turn it back on until leave this session.

If there is already more than 1 people in session and then turned off Matchmaking.
It will still cause randoms join.
So the best way to do is turn it off when only 1 person inside session.

Do not turn matchmaking back on then go start a job then turn it back off.
It probably will cause randoms to join.

This tool may require run as administrator.
