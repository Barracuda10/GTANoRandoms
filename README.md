How to create a No Randoms Session:
-  Join a public session with other players in it and with matchmaking on.
-  Make a solo session and after that wait for few seconds turn matchmaking off.
-  Turn matchmaking back on before leaving this session or host a job.

Usage is also included inside program manual.



Notice:
-  This program may require run as administrator.
-  Due to game default set matchmaking on, therefore this program will automatically turn matchmaking back on when starting it and closing it.
-  This program will not work when using VPN or proxy.



Cautions:

If turn matchmaking back on it will immidiately have randoms join sometimes.
Therefore it's better to never turn it back on until leave this session.

If there is already more than 1 people in session and then turned off Matchmaking.
It will still cause randoms join.
So the best way to do is turn it off when only 1 person inside session.

Do not turn matchmaking back on then go start a job then turn it back off.
It probably will cause randoms to join.

This tool may require run as administrator.
