<h4>Cautions</h4>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;Things unavailable when matchmaking is off, because game will require to use matchmaking service:<br>
-  Host any job or heist that require launch session (Join others doesn't include)<br>
-  Make a solo session (It will kick to story mode)<br>
-  <del>[PROVED AVAILABLE] Join friend through social club</del><br>
-  <del>[PROVED AVAILABLE] Find a new session</del><br>
-  <del>[PROVED AVAILABLE] Join online</del><br>

<br>
2&nbsp;&nbsp;If turn matchmaking back on it will immidiately cause randoms join sometimes, and even if turn it back off quickly<br>
Therefore it's better to never turn it back on until leave this session.<br>
<br>
3&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is already more than 1 people in session and then go turn Matchmaking off.<br>
It will still cause randoms to join.<br>
So the best way to use is turn it off when only 1 person inside.<br>
