Usage is included inside program manual.

If you turn matchmaking back on it will immidiately have randoms join sometimes.
Therefore it's better to never turn it back on until leave this session.

If there is already more than 1 people in session and after that turn off Matchmaking.
It will still cause randoms join.
So the best way to do is turn it off when only 1 person inside session.

Do not turn matchmaking back on then go start a job then turn it back off.
It probably will cause randoms to join.

This tool may require run as administrator.
