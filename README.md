<h2>How to create a No Randoms Session:</h2>
<br>
<h4>Way 1 [Around 20% times randoms still will join]</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Join a public session with other players in it and with matchmaking on.</li>
  <li>Make a solo session and after that wait for few seconds turn matchmaking off.</li>
  <li>Turn matchmaking back on before host a job or heist that require launch session.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Way 2 [Newly Discovered]</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Join a invite only session with matchmaking on.</li>
  <li>Turn matchmaking off then find a new session and the new session should be a empty session</li>
  <li>Turn matchmaking back on before host a job or heist that require launch session.</li>
</ul>
Usage is also included inside it's manual.<br>
<br>

<h2>Cautions:</h2>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;Things unavailable when matchmaking is off, because game will require to use matchmaking service:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Host any job or heist that require launch session (Join others doesn't include)</li>
  <li>Make a solo session (It will kick to story mode)</li>
  <li><del>[PROVED AVAILABLE] Join friend through social club</del></li>
  <li><del>[PROVED AVAILABLE] Find a new session</del></li>
  <li><del>[PROVED AVAILABLE] Join online</del></li>
</ul>
<br>
2&nbsp;&nbsp;If turn matchmaking back on it will immidiately cause randoms join sometimes, and even if turn it back off quickly<br>
Therefore it's better to never turn it back on until leave this session.<br>
<br>
3&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is already more than 1 people in session and then go turn Matchmaking off, It usually will still cause randoms to join. So the best way to use this is turn it off while only 1 person in the session.<br>
