### How to create a No Randoms Session<br>
-  Join a public session with other players in it and with matchmaking on.<br>
-  Make a solo session and after that wait for few seconds turn matchmaking off.<br>
-  Turn matchmaking back on before leave this session or host a job.<br>
<br>
Usage is also included inside it's manual.<br>
<br>

#### Notice <br>
-  This program may require run as administrator.<br>
-  Due to game default set matchmaking on, it will automatically turn matchmaking back on while starting it and closing it.<br>
-  This program will not work when using VPN or proxy.<br>
<br>

#### Cautions <br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;Things unavailable when matchmaking is off, because game will require to use matchmaking service:<br>
-  Host any job or heist that require launch session (Join others doesn't include)<br>
-  [NOT SURE] Find a new session<br>
-  [NOT SURE] Join a friend session<br>
-  Make a solo session (It will kick you to story mode)<br>
-  Join online (Probably only if join a public session will require)<br>
<br>
2&nbsp;&nbsp;If turn matchmaking back on it will immidiately cause randoms join sometimes, and even if turn it back off quickly<br>
Therefore it's better to never turn it back on until leave this session.<br>
<br>
3&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is already more than 1 people in session and then go turn Matchmaking off.<br>
It will still cause randoms to join.<br>
So the best way to use is turn it off when only 1 person inside.<br>
